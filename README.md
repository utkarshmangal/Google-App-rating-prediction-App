# Google-App-rating-prediction-App


This repository contains a Python application for Predicting the ratings of Google apps using various machine learning techniques. The application utilizes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to preprocess the data, visualize insights, perform dimensionality reduction using PCA, and create a predictive model using Random Forest Regression.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and categorical features are encoded to prepare the data for analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and seaborn are used to create informative visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to better understand the dataset.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining important information.

- **Machine Learning Model**: A Random Forest Regression model is trained on the processed data to predict Google app ratings based on various features.

## Requirements

To run the application successfully, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Note

This application is a basic example of using machine learning techniques for predicting Google app ratings. The model's accuracy may vary depending on the dataset and feature selection. Advanced preprocessing techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection may be necessary for more accurate predictions.

Feel free to customize, enhance, or adapt this application for your specific use case. For critical applications, it is recommended to consult with experts and employ more advanced techniques.
